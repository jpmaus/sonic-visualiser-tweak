To compile from source
----------------------

This file provides various instructions useful when compiling the SV
libraries from source, but it doesn't have a complete recipe for any
one platform -- there are too many variables.  However, you can find a
recipe for one platform (Ubuntu Linux) in the file INSTALL.ubuntu.

To build, run

$ ./configure && make

The following additional libraries are required or optional when
building the SV core libraries:

REQUIRED	Qt v4.4 or newer	http://qt.nokia.com/
REQUIRED	Vamp Plugin SDK	v2.x	http://www.vamp-plugins.org/
REQUIRED	Rubber Band Library	http://www.breakfastquay.com/rubberband/
REQUIRED	libsndfile		http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/
REQUIRED	libsamplerate		http://www.mega-nerd.com/SRC/
REQUIRED	FFTW3 			http://www.fftw.org/
REQUIRED	bzip2 library		http://www.bzip.org/
REQUIRED	Redland RDF libraries	http://librdf.org/

Optional	MAD mp3 decoder		http://www.underbit.com/products/mad/
Optional	Oggz and fishsound	http://www.annodex.net/software/libraries.html
Optional        liblo OSC library	http://www.plugin.org.uk/liblo/

The Redland RDF libraries include the Raptor RDF parser library,
Rasqal RDF query library, and librdf, the Redland RDF datastore (which
depends on both of those).  The SV libraries require all of these.

If you are going to build the rest of the SV libraries, you will also
need one or more of:

Optional	JACK			http://www.jackaudio.org/
Optional	PortAudio v19		http://www.portaudio.com/
Optional	PulseAudio    	 	http://www.pulseaudio.org/

Although JACK, PortAudio, and PulseAudio are individually optional,
you will need to have one or the other of them in order to get any
audio playback.  Usually JACK is preferred on Linux, with PulseAudio
as a backup, and PortAudio is used elsewhere.

On Linux, you will need the ALSA libraries (used for MIDI).

If you happen to be using a Debian-based Linux, you probably want to
apt-get install the following packages: libqt4-dev libsndfile1-dev
libsamplerate0-dev fftw3-dev libbz2-dev libjack-dev libmad0-dev
liboggz1-dev libfishsound1-dev libasound2-dev liblo0-dev liblrdf0-dev
librdf0-dev .
