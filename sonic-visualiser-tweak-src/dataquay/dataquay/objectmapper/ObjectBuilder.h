 * \class ObjectBuilder ObjectBuilder.h <dataquay/objectmapper/ObjectBuilder.h>
 *
 * ObjectBuilder is a singleton object factory capable of constructing
 * new objects of classes that are subclassed from QObject.  Given the
 * class name as a string, and optionally a parent object, it will
 * return a new instance of the class.  To be capable of construction
 * using ObjectBuilder, a class must be declared using Q_OBJECT as
 * well as subclassed from QObject.
 *
 * All candidate object classes need to be registered with the builder
 * before they can be constructed.  The only class that ObjectBuilder
 * is able to construct without registration is QObject itself.
 *
 * This class permits code to construct new objects dynamically,
 * without needing to know anything about them except for their class
 * names, and without needing their definitions to be visible.  (The
 * definitions must be visible when the object classes are registered,
 * but not when the objects are constructed.)
