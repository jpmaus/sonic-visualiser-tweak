Sonic Visualiser
================

Sonic Visualiser is a program for viewing and analysing the contents
of music audio files.

With Sonic Visualiser you can:

 * Load audio files in various formats (WAV/AIFF, plus Ogg and mp3
if compiled in) and view their waveforms
 
 * Look at audio visualisations such as spectrogram views, with
interactive adjustment of display parameters

 * Annotate audio data by adding labelled time points and defining
segments, point values and curves

 * Run feature-extraction plugins to calculate annotations
automatically, using algorithms such as beat trackers, pitch
detectors and so on (see http://vamp-plugins.org/)

 * Import annotation data from various text formats and MIDI files

 * Play back the original audio with synthesised annotations, taking
care to synchronise playback with the display position

 * Slow down and speed up playback and loop segments of interest,
including seamless looping of complex non-contiguous areas

 * Export annotations and audio selections to external files.

Sonic Visualiser can also be controlled remotely using the Open Sound
Control (OSC) protocol (if support is compiled in).
